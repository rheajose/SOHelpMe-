'SOHelpMe' is an eclipse plugin I developed for my Java project, that integrates with Stack Overfow and prints enhanced error message below 
original compiler error message on console. The enhanced message is nothing but the Stack Overflow response which is tailored according to requirements 
and pasted on the console. The idea behind developing this plugin is to generate a better quality error message and help programmer's time 
surfing on the internet to understand the cryptic compiler error message generated by the Eclipse's Java compiler. 
This plugin can be mainly helpful for novice programmers who have difficulty in understanding the compiler error messages.
